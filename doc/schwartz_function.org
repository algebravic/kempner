How would I construct Schwartz functions
$f_1^\varepsilon, f_2^\varepsilon$ on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $f_1^\varepsilon(x) \le
1_{[a,b]}(x) \le f_2^\varepsilon(x)$ and
$f_1^\varepsilon \rightarrow 1_{[a,b]}$, $f_1^\varepsilon \rightarrow 1_{[a,b]}$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.

where $a < b$ are real numbers and $1_{[a,b]}$ is the indicator function?

The quickest way is to convolve the characteristic function of another
interval with a smooth [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_function][bump function]].  Let $\Phi(x)=c \exp(- 1/(1-x^2))
\chi(-1,1)$, where $c > 0$ is chosen to make $\int_{-1}^1 \Phi(x) dx =
1$. For $\varepsilon > 0$ define $\Psi_\varepsilon(x) =
\varepsilon^{-1} \Phi(x/\varepsilon)$ The convolutions
$f_1^\varepsilon = 1_{[a+\varepsilon, b - \varepsilon]} \star
\Psi_\varepsilon$ and $f_1^\varepsilon = 1_{[a-\varepsilon, b +
\varepsilon]} \star \Psi_\varepsilon$ have the required properties,
which I leave for you to check.

** My check

Since $\Phi_\varepsilon(x) \ge 0$, we have $\Phi_\varepsilon \star
I_{[a-\varepsilon,b + \varepsilon]}(y)  =
\int_{y - b-\varepsilon}^{y - a+\varepsilon} \Phi_\varepsilon( x) dx$.

However $\Phi_\varepsilon$ is supported on $(-\varepsilon,
\varepsilon)$ so the above integral is
$\int_{\max(y - b - \varepsilon,- \varepsilon)}^{\min(y-a-\varepsilon,
\varepsilon)} \Phi_\varepsilon(x)dx$.

If $y \in [a, b]$ the limits of the above integral are $(-\varepsilon,
\varepsilon)$, in which case the integral is 1 by construction, and so
is $\ge I_{[a,b]}(y)$. Otherwise the integral is $\ge 0$ by
construction, and so is also $\ge I_{[a,b]}(y)$. In that case the
integral is $\le 2 \varepsilon$ since $\Phi_\varepsilon(x) \le 1$.

A similar argument works with the lower bound.

There is even simpler example from this book of Loring Tu.
You simply start with
$$f(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t \le 0 \\ e^{-1/t} & t > 0 \end{cases}.$$

Then you define
$g(t) = \frac{f(t)}{f(t) + f(1-t)}$
and shift it to the right by creating
$h(t) = g(t-1)$
To make it symmetric you put
$k(t) = h(t^2)$
and finally to make it look like bump function you put
$\rho(t) = 1-k(t)$.

As you can tell from the picture, Loring Tu covered more general case
(he even generalised this construction to smooth manifolds of
arbitrary dimension).

For more details and picutres go to Tu's book.

Presumably what you want is a function that is $\mathcal{C}^\infty$
on $\mathbb{R}$, nonzero on $(âˆ’1,1)$ and zero elsewhere. It's
convenient to use something involving the exponential function because
it's nonzero everywhere but goes to faster than any polynomial at
$-\infty$ and it's easy to differentiate. If you really want to avoid
the exponential function, you might try something like
$1/I_0(1/(1-x^2))$, for $-1 < x < 1$, where $I_0$ is a modified Bessel function of order 0.

For an example that has a closed-form antiderivative, you might try
$\frac{(x^2+1)e^{\frac{4x}{x^2-1}}}{\left( (x^2-1)\left( 1+e^{\frac{4x}{x^2-1}}\right)\right)^2}$

1) Start with any function $f(x)$ that grows faster than all
   polynomials i.e. $\forall N, \lim_{x \rightarrow
   \infty}\frac{x^N}{f(x)} = 0$. For example, $e^x$.
2) Then consider the function $g(x) = \frac{1}{f(1/x)}$. This is a
   function that is flatter than all polynomials near zero,
   i.e. $\forall N, \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{g(x)}{x^N} = 0$. This
   is a smooth non-analytic function. For the above example you get $e^{-1/x}$.
3) Consider the function $h(x) = g(1+x) g(1-x)$. This, after zeroing
   out the stuff outside the interval $(-1,1)$, is a bump
   function. For our example $e^{2/(x^2-1)}$
4) Scale and transform to your liking.
Just do this with different kinds of of growth functions $f$, and
you'll get different "kinds" of bump functions, $h$. So here are some
functions that I could generated with this method - try to guess which
functions they're from:

$h(x) = e^{2/(x^2-1)}$

$h(x) = (1+x)^{1/(1+x)}(1-x)^{1/(1-x)}$

$h(x) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{1+x}!\frac{1}{1-x}!}$

$h(x) = e^{-\ln^2(1+x) +\ln^2(1-x)}$.

And the more rapidly your function $f(x)$ grows, the nicer the bump
function $h(x)$ looks.
