Dear Math Fun and Seq Fans,

Let V(n) mean: write n in base 10 but read it as if it were base 11.

E.g. V(27) = 2*11 + 7 = 29. V(n) is A171397.

V is interesting because although the harmonic series Sum 1/n diverges, it
is a classic result that S1 = Sum 1/V(n) converges.

The decimal expansion of S1 is in A375805, but only 3 decimal places are
known.


Second, V(prime_n) is A031216. What is S2 = Sum 1/V(prime_n)?

Its value is in A375863, but only 1 decimal place is known.


Could someone calculate S1 and S2 more accurately?

As William Cheswick always says, "If brute force doesn't work, use more
brute force".


Best regards
Neil
