On 1 September, 2024, Neil Sloane posed the following query to the
~math-fun~ mailing list:
#+begin_quote
Let $V(n)$ mean: write n in base 10 but read it as if it were base 11.
E.g. $V(27) = 2*11 + 7 = 29$. $V(n)$ is ~A171397~.

$V$ is interesting because although the harmonic series $\sum_n 1/n$ diverges, it
is a classic result that $S_1 = \sum_n 1/V(n)$ converges.

The decimal expansion of $S_1$ is in ~A375805~, but only 3 decimal places
are known.

Second, $V(\text{prime}_n)$ is ~A031216~. What is $S_2 = \sum 1/V(\text{prime}_n)$?
Its value is in ~A375863~, but only 1 decimal place is known.

Could someone calculate $S_1$ and $S_2$ more accurately?

As William Cheswick always says, "If brute force doesn't work, use more
brute force".
